# Ethereum Smart Contract Registry

A decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to register, verify, and validate the authenticity of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This system provides a transparent and immutable record of contract changes and audits.

## Features

- Smart contract registration on Ethereum blockchain
- Contract authenticity verification
- User-friendly interface for contract validation
- Comprehensive change history and audit trail
- Secure and decentralized storage of contract information

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)
- Metamask browser extension
- Ethereum wallet with some ETH for gas fees (on the desired network)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ethereum-smart-contract-registry.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```
   cd ethereum-smart-contract-registry
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Ethereum network details:
   ```
   REACT_APP_ETHEREUM_NETWORK=rinkeby
   REACT_APP_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Connect your Metamask wallet to the application

4. Use the interface to:
   - Register new smart contracts
   - Verify existing contracts
   - View contract history and audits

## Smart Contract Interaction

The main smart contract for this project is located at `contracts/ContractRegistry.sol`. To interact with it:

1. Compile the contract:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. Deploy the contract to your chosen network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
   ```
3. Update the contract address in `src/config.js` with the newly deployed address

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```
npm test
```
